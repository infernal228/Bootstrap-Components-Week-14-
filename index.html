              Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the Nicotiana
              genus and the Solanaceae (nightshade) family, and the general term
              for any product prepared from the cured leaves of the tobacco
              plant. More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief
              commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica
              is also used around the world. Tobacco contains the stimulant
              alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Dried tobacco
              leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars as well
              as pipes and shishas . They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing
              tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.

              Tobacco use is one of the most important preventable causes of
              premature death in the world. More than 6 million people per year
              die from tobacco use across the globe. There is no question that
              limiting tobacco use is one of the most effective ways to save
              lives and improve overall well-being. Smoking tobacco causes
              exposure to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals,
              including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly
              every organ system in the human body. Harms from tobacco begin
              before birth, as pregnant women who smoke give birth to infants at
              higher risk of congenital disorders, cancer, lung diseases, and
              sudden death. Newly identified risks from smoking include renal
              failure, intestinal ischemia, and hypertensive heart disease. The
              risk of death and disease from tobacco rises with the number of
              cigarettes smoked, but damage begins with use of a very small
              number of cigarettes. A regular life-long smoker loses at least
              10â€“11 years of life to tobacco on average. In addition, exposure
              to secondhand or environmental tobacco smoke is associated with
              increased risk of cancer and heart disease, among other
              deleterious health effects. Lung cancer is now the leading cause
              of cancer death in the world. It has long been the leading cause
              of cancer death among men, and in many countries is now also the
              leading cause of cancer death among women, outpacing breast
              cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the
              leading causes of death in the world, and mortality from this
              condition is increasing in most countries; globally, 45% of all
              deaths from COPD are attributed to tobacco use. Similarly, death
              from heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death in
              the world, are heavily tied to tobacco use. Combustible tobacco
              use is extremely hazardous to human health and is responsible for
              more than 90% of tobacco-attributable death and disease, despite
              efforts by the tobacco industry to market safer-sounding
              alternatives such as low-tar cigarettes and water pipes.
              Therefore, a top priority is to avoid combustible tobacco
              products, and the only way for an individual to completely
              eliminate tobacco-related harms is not to use them.

          <p class="lead">
            An electronic cigarette, also known as e-cigarette among other
            names, is a handheld battery-powered vaporizer that simulates
            smoking and provides some of the behavioral aspects of smoking,
            including the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, but without burning
            tobacco. Using an e-cigarette is known as "vaping" and the user is
            referred to as a "vaper." Instead of cigarette smoke, the user
            inhales an aerosol, commonly called vapor. E-cigarettes typically
            have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called
            e-liquid. E-cigarettes are automatically activated by taking a puff;
            others turn on manually by pressing a button. Some e-cigarettes look
            like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations. Most
            versions are reusable, though some are disposable. There are
            first-generation, second-generation, third-generation, and
            fourth-generation devices. There are also pod mod devices that use
            nicotine in the form of a protonated nicotine, rather than free-base
            nicotine found in earlier generations. E-liquids usually contain
            propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and
            differing amounts of contaminants. E-liquids are also sold without
            propylene glycol, nicotine, or flavors.

              The benefits and the health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain.
              There is tentative evidence they may help people quit smoking,
              although they have not been proven to be more effective than
              smoking cessation medicine. There is concern with the possibility
              that non-smokers and children may start nicotine use with
              e-cigarettes at a rate higher than anticipated than if they were
              never created. Following the possibility of nicotine addiction
              from e-cigarette use, there is concern children may start smoking
              cigarettes. Youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to go on to
              smoke cigarettes. Their part in tobacco harm reduction is unclear,
              while another review found they appear to have the potential to
              lower tobacco-related death and disease. Regulated US Food and
              Drug Administration (US FDA) nicotine replacement products may be
              safer than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are generally seen as
              safer than combusted tobacco products. The risk of early death is
              anticipated to be similar to that of smokeless tobacco. The
              long-term effects of e-cigarette use are unknown. The risk from
              serious adverse events was reported in 2016 to be low. Less
              serious adverse effects include abdominal pain, headache, blurry
              vision, throat and mouth irritation, vomiting, nausea, and
              coughing. Nicotine itself is associated with some health harms. In
              2019, an outbreak of severe lung illness across multiple states in
              the US was linked to vaping.

              First off, some people think that vape is harmless. In fact, this
              is not so. Since the vapor contains the same poison as in
              cigarettes, that is, nicotine, vape remains a harmful addiction.
              However, at the same time, it is worth saying that with steam a
              person does not inhale associated resins, harmful compounds that
              are contained in large amounts of smoke in an ordinary cigarette
              butt.
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              Secondly, prolonged inhalation of steam by a person has not yet
              been fully studied, the possible side effects that soaring has on
              the body have not been investigated. Today, most liquids are based
              on propylene glycol and glycerol, which are mixed in different
              proportions. Some sweaters may have intolerance to these
              compounds, despite the fact that they are relatively harmless.
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              Thirdly, many people think that vaping is financially more
              profitable than tobacco. In a way, it is, but only at a distance.
              Initial spending on the purchase of an ideal device, often not
              cheap, the choice of an optimal fluid, can be significant. If you
              chase unjustified savings and buy something too cheap, then the
              comfort of soaring can be reduced to zero. Yes, and health is not
              worth the risk, buying unknown liquids at too attractive a price.
